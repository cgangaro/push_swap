# Push_swap

This project involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions with the lowest possible number of actions. The challenge is to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution for optimized data sorting.

This project involves sorting data using two stacks (a and b) with a limited set of instructions: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, and rrr.

- sa (swap a): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack a. Does nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first two elements at the top of stack b. Does nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- ss (swap both): Perform sa and sb simultaneously.
- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Does nothing if b is empty.
- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Does nothing if a is empty.
- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by one. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by one. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr (rotate both): Perform ra and rb simultaneously.
- rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by one. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by one. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr (reverse rotate both): Perform rra and rrb simultaneously.
